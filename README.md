Precompiled packages for powerpc64 is used on my PS3. Cross building packages from aports of Alpine Linux. It is tested successly in my ps3 by using precompiled 3.15 kernel from <a href=https://gitlab.com/aethyx/ps3linux/tree/master/Precompiled%20Debian%208.x%20(Jessie)%20kernels/functional>AETHYX MEDIAE
</a>, thanks you very much fiends. Now I can run Alpine Linux rooted in ps3vram, because my ps3 hardisk dosen't work well.
